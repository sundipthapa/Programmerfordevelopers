/*
You are given an array of binary trees that represent different cities where a certain corporation has its branch office and the organization wishes to provide service by constructing a service center. Building service centers at any node, i.e., a city can give service to its directly connected cities where it can provide service to its parents, itself, and its immediate children. Returns the smallest number of service centers required by the corporation to provide service to all connected cities. Note that: the root node represents the head office and other connected nodes represent the branch office connected to the head office maintaining some kind of hierarchy.

Input: tree= {0,0, null, 0, null, 0, null, null, 0}
Output: 2
Explanation: construction of two service centers denoted by black markk will be enough to provide service to all cities.
